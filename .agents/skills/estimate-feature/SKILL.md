# Estimate Feature

Estimate active engineering hours for a developer using an AI coding agent.
Never run this optional skill unless the user requests an estimate.

## Process

1. Require a completed plan under `docs/agent-devkit/plans/`. If none exists,
   tell the user to invoke `plan-feature` only when the user also requested a
   plan and an approved design exists; otherwise stop and request a plan. Never
   estimate directly from a feature request.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, the plan, linked design, relevant wiki, source, and tests.
   Call the available Skill entry whose local name is `read-codebase-context`
   when source exists. If the plan has an `## Impact map`, follow its map-refresh
   rule: validate the recorded commit, find tracked and untracked paths changed
   since then, and confirm every mapped entry-point and implementation symbol
   across the repository. If the baseline is missing, unavailable, or no longer
   an ancestor, trace existing source from scratch. Do not try to trace planned
   entry points, callers, or tests that do not exist yet; use planned files,
   interfaces, behavior, and verification only from the approved design and
   plan. Mark unspecified behavior as unknown and block an estimate when it
   prevents a defensible range. Re-trace planned paths only after source exists.
   Read current source for every existing file the plan says implementation
   will edit. For a planned file that does not exist yet, use the approved
   design and plan; do not treat that file as traced source. If
   tasks omit files, behavior, or verification, tell the user to invoke
   `plan-feature`.
3. State the AI support profile. Assume the coding agent can inspect and edit
   source, write and run tests, and update documentation, while a developer
   reviews output and resolves product decisions. Include context gathering,
   prompting, coding, tests, expected debugging, review, and planned docs.
   Exclude waiting, stakeholder response, deployment, and manual QA unless
   planned.
4. Estimate every plan task with a defensible hours range, confidence, and
   evidence-based rationale. Consider local patterns, novelty, touched files,
   migrations, integrations, test cost, and unresolved dependencies. Never
   apply a generic "AI is N% faster" discount. When an unknown prevents a
   defensible range, mark the task `Blocked: spike required` and keep it in the
   task table with `Blocked` in Hours, `N/A` confidence, and the unknown in its
   rationale. Exclude blocked tasks from the total and report their count. While
   any task is blocked, total confidence cannot be `High`. If every task is
   blocked, report the total as `Not estimable — spike required` and total
   confidence as `N/A`.
5. Save a new estimate at
   `docs/agent-devkit/estimates/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-estimate.md`. Follow the
   shared artifact naming rule in `using-devkit` (read it if it is not loaded),
   and link to the exact plan filename.
   Create `docs/agent-devkit/estimates/` only now if it does not exist. Use:

   ```md
   # Feature Estimate

   ## Plan
   - <link to the exact plan file>

   ## AI support profile
   <included effort and exclusions>

   ## Task estimates
   | Plan task | Hours | Confidence | Basis and risks |
   |---|---:|---|---|
   | Task 1: <name> | 2-4h | Medium | <repo evidence and uncertainty> |
   | Task N: <name> | Blocked | N/A | Blocked: spike required — <unknown> |

   ## Total
   - Active engineering effort: <sum of estimable ranges, or `Not estimable — spike required` if all tasks are blocked>
   - Blocked tasks: <N excluded from the effort total; `0 (all tasks estimable)` when none>
   - Confidence: <High/Medium/Low; not High if any task is blocked; `N/A` if all are blocked>

   ## Open unknowns
   - <unresolved information behind a blocked estimate, or "None">
   ```

6. Add `## Estimate` with a link to the estimate in the plan, and add the
   estimate to `docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md` under `## Estimates`. Follow the
   shared process-artifact link and wiki-boundary rules in `using-devkit` (read
   them if they are not loaded).
7. Treat the estimate as stale when the linked plan's tasks, files, behavior,
   verification, or assumptions change. On refresh, compare the whole current
   plan with the estimate, then update the same estimate file and totals.
8. Verify every plan task appears exactly once as a row in `Task estimates`,
   blocked rows follow step 4, the blocked-task count in the total matches the
   table, and range totals include only estimable tasks. If all tasks are
   blocked, verify the total and confidence follow step 4. Verify all links
   resolve and `git diff --check` passes. Do not repeat task rows in `Open
   unknowns`; list only the unresolved information there. Do not edit
   application code, start implementation, or create a commit.
