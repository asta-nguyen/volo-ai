# Plan Feature

Turn an approved design into a short execution plan before editing code. For a
change folder, save `tasks.md` beside its `design.md` under
`docs/agent-devkit/changes/<folder>/`. For a legacy design with no change
folder, save the plan at
`docs/agent-devkit/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-plan.md`. Follow the shared artifact
naming rule in `using-devkit` (read it if it is not loaded). Create the folder
only when writing the plan.

## Process

1. Read the approved design, `AGENTS.md`, and related wiki pages. If application
   source exists, call the available Skill entry whose local name is
   `read-codebase-context` to inspect
   affected source,
   callers, and tests. Otherwise map planned files and interfaces from the
   approved design; state that callers and tests do not exist yet.
   Apply the change lifecycle in `using-devkit`: revise an open change's
   `tasks.md` in place; for new architectural work after a change is archived,
   use a new approved design and change folder. An open legacy plan is revised
   in place (same file, decision log, and approval gate); do not recreate it, and
   start a new plan only when the old one is complete. Keep completed tasks and
   results historical; add new work as a new task only while the change is open.
   Extract only exact constraints from the approved design that bind more than
   one task. Do not infer constraints from convention or preference.
2. Map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is
   responsible for. Design units with clear boundaries. Follow existing
   patterns; do not unilaterally restructure. Before accepting a proposed unit,
   apply this minimal-design ladder in order and stop at the first option that
   satisfies the approved behavior:

   1. Does this need to exist at all? Remove work that no approved requirement
      needs (YAGNI).
   2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse the module, helper, type, or
      pattern.
   3. Does the standard library do it? Use it.
   4. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
   5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
   6. Only then, plan the minimum clear new code that works.

   Every new file, abstraction, dependency, or configuration value must map to
   an approved requirement. Minimal design must not remove explicit behavior,
   trust-boundary validation, security, accessibility, or error handling that
   prevents data loss.
3. Split the work into small, ordered tasks. Each task must state:

   ```text
   Files: <paths anchored as path::SymbolName; line ranges only for files without symbols>
   Interfaces: <what this task consumes from earlier tasks and produces for later ones>
   Change: <observable behavior or implementation>
   Verify: <smallest relevant test/check>
   ```

   Plans specify implementation; they do not pre-write code. Do not include
   function bodies or full test code; `implement-task` writes code. Include
   exact snippets only when a precise string, regex, config value, or contract
   shape is itself the requirement.

   For cross-file work, also list `Files inspected, no change` so the plan
   distinguishes evidence from guesses.

   Map every approved edge case to a task and specific verification. If
   planning exposes an unresolved case that would change observable behavior,
   scope, an interface, a schema, or a protected boundary, tell the user to
   invoke `brainstorm-feature`; do not invent the behavior. Leave only
   behavior-equivalent implementation details for `implement-task` rulings.

4. Give each task only the steps needed for its change and a meaningful
   `Verify` check. Use an existing test runner and a failing test when that
   test protects changed behavior. If the project has no tests, use a
   repeatable check available in the project; do not add a unit-test runner
   solely to satisfy the plan. Record the expected result. If no check can
   establish a required behavior, mark it `cannot verify` instead of claiming
   coverage.

   For a source-less new project, the first task bootstraps the runtime and
   first entry point approved in the design. State its verification procedure.
   If the design does not establish the runtime, build tool, first entry point,
   or verification approach, tell the user to invoke `brainstorm-feature`;
   do not invent a toolchain.

5. Put contract/data changes before their callers; put tests beside the
   behavior they verify. Do not add tasks for speculative abstractions.
6. Do not add `review-and-verify` as an implementation task. After all plan
   tasks are complete, `implement-task` owns the final review and verification.
7. Add this section to every plan or `tasks.md`:

   ```md
   ## Approval Gate

   Required: yes | no
   Reason: <public API, data schema, dependency, CI, broad file impact, or low-risk scope>
   Status: pending | approved | not-required

   ## Decision Log

   None.
   ```

   Set `Required: yes` when the work changes public APIs, data schemas,
   dependencies, CI, or more than a small set of files; its initial status is
   always `pending`. Otherwise set `Required: no` and `Status: not-required`.
   A legacy plan in `plans/` also carries `Execution: open | complete`; a
   change's `tasks.md` omits it, because completion is the archive move.
   Approval never marks execution complete. Approval of the design, including an
   instruction to implement given before the plan existed, never changes a
   required gate from `pending`.
8. Save the complete plan. Include `## Approved design` with a relative link to
   the exact approved design, immediately followed by `## Global Constraints`.
   Copy only exact cross-task constraints from the design; write `None.` when
   there are none. Include `## Impact map` using exactly the seven fields in
   `read-codebase-context` step 5. Do not add a second design/spec pointer. For a
   change folder, `tasks.md` links to its sibling `design.md`, the folder is
   already linked under `## Changes` in `docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md`, and there
   is no `## Execution` backlink. For a legacy design, add the plan link to the
   design's `## Execution` section and add both artifacts to
   `docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md` (`## Designs` and `## Plans`). Follow the shared
   process-artifact link and wiki-boundary
   rules in `using-devkit` (read them if they are not loaded). For a planned
   entry point or flow that does not exist yet, keep the seven fields and write
   `Entry: no existing source; planned entry: <approved file + symbol>` and
   `Flow: no existing flow; planned flow: <approved flow>`. Fill planned files,
   effects, and verification only from the approved design. Do not claim
   nonexistent callers or tests were traced.
9. Do not estimate effort in this skill. When the user explicitly requests an
   estimate, tell the user to invoke `estimate-feature` before presenting the
   approval gate; otherwise continue without an estimate. Estimation never
   authorizes implementation.
10. Present the complete plan, requested estimate when present, and approval
   gate. For
   `Required: yes`, stop without editing application code. After the user
   explicitly approves the complete plan, update `Status: pending` to
   `Status: approved` and tell the user to invoke `implement-task`; that
   approval is the gate, so do not ask again. If an open approved plan changes
   materially, append the user-confirmed change to `## Decision Log`, reset its
   `Required` and `Reason` from the new impact, set required plans to
   `Status: pending`, and present them again. For
   `Required: no`, tell the user to invoke `implement-task` with
   `Status: not-required`.
11. Do not include commit steps. If the user requests a commit, leave that action
   until after `review-and-verify` passes.

## No placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are
plan failures — never write them:

- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" (without specifying what)
- Tests described as code instead of named test cases with input → expected result
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the interface, test-case, and verify details the task needs)
- Steps that omit the specific behavior, interface, or check
- References to types or functions not defined in any task

## Self-review

After writing the complete plan, review it against the approved design:

Flag and fix only issues that could change approved behavior, scope, plan
correctness, or execution. Do not block on wording preferences, stylistic
polish, or uneven detail that does not create ambiguity.

1. **Spec coverage** — can you point to a task that implements each
   requirement from the design? List any gaps.
2. **Placeholder scan** — search for any pattern from the "No placeholders"
   section above. Fix them.
3. **Type consistency** — do function names, signatures, parameter types, and
   property names used in later tasks match what was defined earlier?
4. **Artifact links** — do the index, design, and plan links resolve? Does the
   design link only to wiki pages actually read as context?
5. **Approval gate** — do impact and status match the required criteria? Is a
   required gate still pending until the complete plan is approved? Does a legacy
   plan have `Execution: open`, does a revised open plan keep it open, and does
   a change's `tasks.md` omit `Execution`?
6. **Minimal design** — can any proposed file, abstraction, dependency, or
   configuration be removed or replaced by existing, standard-library, native,
   or already-installed behavior without weakening an approved requirement?
7. **Decision consistency** — does every persisted decision agree with the
   tasks and approval status? Material changes must leave the gate pending.
8. **Global constraints** — is each entry copied from the approved design,
   applicable across tasks, and consistent with every task? Is `None.` used
   when the design has no cross-task constraint?
9. **Edge-case coverage** — does every approved edge case map to a task and a
   specific verification? Did unresolved behavior route back to
   `brainstorm-feature` instead of being invented during planning?

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

Plans are execution artifacts, not essays. Prefer the fewest tasks that
make the sequence and verification unambiguous.
