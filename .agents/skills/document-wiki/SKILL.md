# Document Wiki

Create or refresh the target repository's `docs/llm/` from verified source
code. This is the one-stop wiki workflow: do not hand the user off to the
other wiki skills.

## Completion contract

An inventory of routes, files, or modules is baseline coverage, not deep
feature documentation. A selected feature is complete only when its page
explains current business behavior and its claims are traceable to existing
source or tests. If evidence is missing or a check fails, mark the feature
`[~]` and report the gap; never call that page current.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target repository from the user's path or the current directory.
   Read `AGENTS.md`. If `docs/llm/` is missing, run the repository's
   `setup-codebase` procedure inline. Preserve every existing file. Before
   writing links, find the Obsidian vault root: use the nearest ancestor of
   `docs/llm/` containing `.obsidian/`. Internal wikilink targets are relative
   to that vault root. For example, with `docs/.obsidian/`, link to
   `docs/llm/architecture/overview.md` as `[[llm/architecture/overview|Architecture overview]]`.
   If no vault exists, retain the existing `docs/llm`-relative form.
2. Read `docs/llm/AGENTS.md`, `INDEX.md`, and all existing wiki pages. Treat the
   wiki as **empty** when it is missing, contains only the setup skeleton, or
   its pages still contain placeholder text such as `Populate this page` or
   `No pages yet`.
   If the repository has no application source, report that no verified behavior
   exists, preserve the skeleton, and stop. Do not create an overview, feature
   pages, or a `LOG.md` entry from proposed specs or plans.
3. Build a domain map and current feature list from behavior, not filenames.
   Inspect routes, commands, scripts, workers/jobs, public APIs, manifests,
   tests, and README instructions. Use OpenEZ MCP (`code_query`,
   `code_context`, `graph_neighbors`) when available; otherwise use `openez
   status/index` and direct `rg`/file reads. Group behavior by product domain
   such as authentication, billing, projects, or administration only when the
   repository evidence establishes that boundary. For the inventory, inspect
   enough evidence to establish each user-visible behavior and entry point;
   reserve the end-to-end trace for features selected in step 6.
4. Determine coverage before writing deep feature pages. Read every page's
   `## Sources`, then find the latest `LOG.md` entry that names that exact wiki
   page. In a Git repository, compare its source paths with that entry's source
   commit at read time
   using `git diff <commit> -- <source paths>` and inspect
   `git status --porcelain -- <source paths>` for uncommitted or untracked
   changes. Mark coverage `[~]` when either check reports a change, a page is
   partial, omits a material flow stage or source-established side effect, or
   its claims disagree with source. Never use an overview log entry
   to establish a deep page's freshness. If Git history or a page-specific log
   entry is unavailable, do not claim the page is current without re-reading its
   source. Report the repository's **domain map** and a **feature inventory**:

   ```text
   Domain: <name> — <scope, or "not established by repository evidence">

   [ ] / [x] / [~] Feature — what a user or operator can do
       Entry: <route, command, job, or API>
       Sources: <repository paths>
       Wiki: <page or "missing">
   ```

   Use `[ ]` for undocumented, `[x]` for current coverage, and `[~]` for stale
   or partial coverage. Do not report only page names; the domain, feature, and
   entry point are required.
5. Create or refresh the baseline map before deep documentation. If
   `architecture/overview.md` is missing or stale, create its folder and write
   the smallest source-grounded page containing the repository purpose, major
   entry points, a domain table, cross-domain dependencies, and `## Sources`.
   Update `INDEX.md` to link this overview and list every discovered domain.
   The baseline map is automatic even for an empty wiki; it is an orientation
   page, not permission to document every feature in depth.
6. Present `[ ]` and `[~]` features grouped by domain as a short selectable
   list and stop. Do not create or refresh deep feature pages until the user
   explicitly selects features; a generic request to document the repository
   is not selection. Apply this gate even when the wiki was empty. If the user
   says “all”, select all listed features. Record the selected features in the
   final report.
7. Group selected behavior into the smallest set of evidence-backed categories.
   Use only categories that have a real page to contain:

   | Category | Use for |
   |---|---|
   | `architecture/` | Cross-cutting structure, boundaries, and API topology |
   | `domains/` | Domain concepts, state models, and business rules |
   | `workflows/` | User or operator flows across multiple components |
   | `integrations/` | Stripe, storage, email, and other external systems |
   | `operations/` | Jobs, cron, deployment, maintenance, and runbooks |
   | `decisions/` | Source-backed architectural decisions or existing ADRs |

   A page belongs in the category that best describes its primary subject; link
   related categories instead of duplicating the page. Create a folder only
   when writing its first real page; never create placeholder folders. For
   small repositories, `architecture/`, `decisions/` and `workflows/` may be sufficient.
   Before documenting each selected feature, build and check this evidence
   matrix. Do not draft the page while a row is unverified; write `not
   established by source` and mark the feature `[~]` when the repository does
   not establish it:

   | Required evidence | What to verify |
   |---|---|
   | Entry and caller | Route, command, job, webhook, or API and its inbound caller |
   | Use case | Service/domain method and important downstream calls |
   | State | Persistence, status transitions, and returned user-visible result |
   | Side effects | Storage, external APIs, DB writes, queues, events, email, notifications |
   | Rules | Authorization, plan/access checks, validation, limits, and invariants |
   | Errors | Important rejected, missing, retry, and failure paths |
   | Tests | Matching tests found by searching the repository |

   Then trace it end to end:

   ```text
   entry point and inbound caller
   → service/use-case callees
   → persistence and state changes
   → storage/external adapters
   → jobs, events, email, and notifications
   → authorization, constraints, and error paths
   → relevant tests
   ```

   Continue until the source establishes the user-visible outcome and material
   side effects. Do not stop at a controller, but do not list unrelated helpers
   merely because they are reachable. Then create or update the smallest
   relevant page with these required sections:

   If one page covers multiple selected features, repeat these sections for
   each feature or split the page. Do not let one generic section stand in for
   separate feature behavior.

   ```md
   # Feature name

   ## Business rules

   Current source- or test-backed invariants. Do not invent product requirements.

   ## Flow

   Source-grounded happy path.

   ## State changes

   Persisted states and transitions, including the user-visible outcome.

   ## Side effects

   Storage, external services, queues, events, email, or notifications.

   ## Authorization & constraints

   Access checks, validation, limits, and plan restrictions.

   ## Error paths

   Important failures, retries, and not-found or rejection behavior.

   ## Tests

   Relevant test paths, or `Tests: none found` after an explicit repository search.

   ## Related

   - [[architecture/overview|Architecture overview]]

   ## Sources

   - `path/to/source`
   - `path/to/test` (when a relevant test exists)
   ```

   `## Sources` must list every inspected file that materially supports the
   documented flow; do not pad it with unrelated paths. List exact existing
   file paths only: never use `*`, `**`, or a directory as a source entry. Keep
   prose concise.
   Never turn a helper, file, or inferred product idea
   into a feature. If evidence is missing, omit the claim or label it an open
   question. Use Obsidian wikilinks (`[[path/to/page|Label]]`) for internal
   wiki pages, with targets relative to the vault root determined in step 1;
   use ordinary Markdown links only for external URLs. Add a
   `## Related` section to every non-overview page when a related wiki page
   exists. YAML frontmatter is optional and should not be invented just for
   formatting. Before stating `Tests: none found`, search the repository's
   test tree for the feature's route, service, domain terms, and state names.
   Never invent a test path.
8. Update `docs/llm/INDEX.md` with working links and append one structured entry
   to `docs/llm/LOG.md` after the baseline or selected pages change:

   ```md
   ## YYYY-MM-DD

   Source commit at read time: <git HEAD SHA, or "not a Git repository">

   - Page: <wiki page created or refreshed>
     Sources:
   - <source path checked for this page>
   ```

   This records the source snapshot used for freshness checks. It is not a
   commit created by the agent and does not imply the wiki changes were committed.

   Update `docs/llm/FEATURES.md` only if that file already exists; do not create
   a second tracking system.
9. Verify that every listed source path exists as a file, every internal
   wikilink resolves from the vault root, every index link resolves, every
   `Tests: none found` claim has a recorded search with no matching result, and
   `git diff --check` passes. If any check fails, leave the affected feature
   `[~]` and report the exact failure; do not silently repair the claim or
   report it as current. The final report must repeat the domain map, feature
   inventory, selected features, baseline and deep pages documented, verified
   features skipped, unresolved evidence questions, and verification results.
   Never report only “pages updated”. For every selected feature, include the
   evidence matrix result: each row must name its exact source/test path or
   explicitly say that the repository does not establish it.

Do not modify application code, install dependencies, or invent architecture.
Do not document proposed specs or implementation plans here; `docs/llm/`
describes only verified current behavior grounded in source and tests.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll document this inferred feature" | If evidence is missing, omit the claim or label it an open question. |
| "I'll update the wiki without reading source" | Source establishes facts. Index accelerates discovery. Read the code. |
| "The controller shows the whole flow" | Trace downstream services, state changes, external adapters, jobs, and notifications to the user-visible outcome. |
| "Email or storage is just an implementation detail" | A source-established external side effect or state change is part of the workflow. Document it. |
| "I listed all related files, so the feature is covered" | A file map does not establish business rules, state, side effects, errors, or tests. Complete the evidence matrix. |
| "No tests found" | Search the repository test tree first; matching tests must be listed and used as evidence. |
| "The source path looks plausible" | Verify the exact file exists before adding it to `## Sources`. |
| "The wiki is empty, so I can document every feature now" | Write the baseline map, then wait for deep-coverage selection. |
| "The source path exists, so the page is current" | Compare committed and working-tree changes with that page's recorded source commit. |
| "I'll add a plausible test path" | Document only tests found by evidence; otherwise state none found. |
| "I'll modify application code to match the wiki" | Wiki follows source, never the reverse. |
| "I'll report 'pages updated' and stop" | Report domain, features documented, features skipped, unresolved questions. |
