# Implement Task

## Before coding

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and, when it exists, `docs/llm/INDEX.md` for project
   conventions and affected wiki pages. A missing wiki must not block work.
   If `AGENTS.md` contains `Read CONVENTIONS.md before editing.`, read the
   root `CONVENTIONS.md` too. Apply only rules whose scopes match the changed
   files, with the most specific matching scope winning; route same-scope
   conflicts through user clarification.
2. If application source exists, call the available Skill entry whose local
   name is `read-codebase-context` to trace the relevant code path.
   Understand callers, data flow, and error paths before editing. For a
   source-less new project, read the
   approved spec and plan, then create the first planned entry point; state that
   callers and existing error paths do not exist yet.
   When the active plan has an `## Impact map`, follow the map-refresh rule in
   `read-codebase-context`: validate `Verified at`, inspect tracked and
   untracked paths since that commit, re-trace changed existing paths, and
   confirm every mapped entry-point and implementation symbol across the
   current repository. If the baseline is missing, unavailable, or no longer
   an ancestor, trace existing source from scratch; if the planned source does
   not exist yet, use the source-less map rule instead. Read current source for
   every existing file to edit. For a planned new file, follow the approved
   design and read the source after creating it; the map is navigation, not
   evidence.
3. Follow the approved `plan-feature` output when one exists. Read its
   `## Approval Gate` before editing application code:
   - `Required: yes` proceeds only with `Status: approved`. Missing or `pending`
     status means stop and request approval of the complete plan.
   - `Required: no` proceeds with `Status: not-required`.
   - For a legacy plan with no gate, inspect its impact. Public API, data schema,
     dependency, CI, or broad file changes require approval before proceeding.

   Approval given before the plan existed does not satisfy a required gate.
   Without a plan, require an approved bounded design from `brainstorm-feature`;
   otherwise tell the user to invoke `brainstorm-feature` before editing. An
   eligible explicit-change notice from `brainstorm-feature` satisfies this
   bounded-design gate. If implementation uncovers impact outside the user's
   named scope, stop and return to that approval gate before continuing.
4. Read the active plan/spec's `## Decision Log` and any task-linked decision
   file listed in `docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md`. Conversation memory is not a
   durable decision source. If the current conversation contains a newer user
   answer, persist it through the clarification flow below before using it.
5. After tracing the real flow, apply this implementation ladder in order and
   stop at the first option that satisfies the approved behavior:

   1. Does this need to exist at all? Skip speculative work (YAGNI).
   2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse the module, helper, type, or
      pattern.
   3. Does the standard library do it? Use it.
   4. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
   5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
   6. Only then, write the minimum clear new code that works.

   Do not use minimalism to remove explicit requirements, trust-boundary
   validation, security, accessibility, or error handling that prevents data
   loss.

## During implementation

1. Reuse local patterns. Keep the diff focused on one logical change.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the task. Do not refactor
   unrelated code.
3. If you hit a bug or unexpected behavior, call the available Skill entry
   whose local name is `systematic-debugging`. Do not guess-and-check.
4. Run the smallest relevant check after each non-trivial change.
5. Do not create commits during implementation. Even when the user requests a
   commit, wait until final `review-and-verify` passes.

## Technical rulings

Resolve a choice without user input only when every viable option preserves
the same observable behavior, fits the approved design, plan, decisions, and
repository contract, and changes no API, schema, dependency, security
boundary, scope, or data-loss risk. The choice must be non-destructive and
reversible wholly within the current task, without migration, data rewrite,
external contract changes, or caller changes outside the task.

Choose with the implementation ladder and report:

```text
Ruling R<n>: <choice and concise repository-grounded reason>.
```

Do not persist a technical ruling in `## Decision Log`; it changes no approved
requirement and can be re-derived from source. If any condition above fails,
an approved artifact conflicts, or the action is destructive or irreversible,
use the user clarification and approval flow below.

## Clarification decisions

When implementation needs a user answer before it can continue:

1. Stop editing and ask one question. After the answer, restate it as
   `Decision D<n>: <one unambiguous sentence>` before taking another action.
2. Keep an implementation-only choice in the current session when it changes
   no observable behavior, requirement, API, schema, security boundary, or
   scope. Do not create an artifact for it.
3. Persist every answer that changes observable behavior or an approved
   requirement:
   - When a plan or spec exists, append the decision to its `## Decision Log`.
   - For a bounded task with no plan/spec, create a decision file only when
     the first persistent decision occurs, at
     `docs/agent-devkit/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Follow the shared
     artifact naming rule in `using-devkit` (read it if it is not loaded). Link
     it under `## Decisions` in `docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md` and to the task
     issue or related artifact when one exists, following the shared
     process-artifact link rule in `using-devkit`.

   After persisting the decision, optionally use `memory_write` to store only
   its title and file path; never make memory the only copy. At session start,
   `memory_recall` with 1–3 task keywords may locate decision or handoff files;
   pass `maxTokens` when its schema supports it, and read those files before
   relying on them.

   Use this shape:

   ```md
   ### D<n> — <short title>

   Question: <what was unresolved>
   Decision: <the user's answer>
   Impact: <requirements, tasks, interfaces, or tests affected>
   Confirmed by user: YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

4. If the answer materially changes an approved design or plan, update the
   affected artifact and re-evaluate the plan's approval gate. When the new
   impact requires approval, set `Required: yes`, update `Reason`, set
   `Status: pending`, and stop for approval. If a bounded task expands beyond
   its approved design, tell the user to invoke `brainstorm-feature` instead of
   silently widening scope.
5. Follow the shared process-artifact/wiki boundary in `using-devkit` (read it
   if it is not loaded). Keep `docs/llm/` for verified implemented behavior.

## After implementation

1. Call the available Skill entry whose local name is `review-and-verify` to
   review the diff, run fresh
   verification, and confirm no stale documentation.
2. If the review result is `Status: fail`, fix only the listed blockers, run
   the smallest relevant check, and call the available Skill entry whose local
   name is `review-and-verify` once more. If the second review still fails, stop
   and report the remaining blockers; do not claim completion.

## Documentation impact

The final response repeats the wiki-impact block from `review-and-verify`.
