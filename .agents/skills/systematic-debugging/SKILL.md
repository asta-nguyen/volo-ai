# Systematic Debugging

## Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you have not completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes. Symptom fixes
are failure.

## When to use

Use for any technical issue: test failures, bugs, unexpected behavior,
performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Especially when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- Previous fix did not work
- You do not fully understand the issue

**Do not skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You are in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)

## The four phases

You must complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root cause investigation

**Before attempting any fix:**

1. **Read error messages carefully** — do not skip past errors or warnings.
   Read stack traces completely. Note line numbers, file paths, error codes.
2. **Reproduce consistently** — can you trigger it reliably? What are the
   exact steps? If not reproducible, gather more data; do not guess.
3. **Check recent changes** — `git diff`, recent commits, new dependencies,
   config changes, environmental differences.
4. **Gather evidence in multi-component systems** — when a system has
   multiple components (API → service → database), add diagnostic logging
   at each component boundary before proposing fixes. Log what enters and
   exits each layer. Run once to see where it breaks.
5. **Trace data flow** — where does the bad value originate? What called
   this with the bad value? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix
   at the source, not at the symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern analysis

1. **Find working examples** — locate similar working code in the same
   codebase. What works that is similar to what is broken?
2. **Compare against references** — if implementing a pattern, read the
   reference implementation completely. Do not skim.
3. **Identify differences** — list every difference between working and
   broken, however small. Do not assume "that can't matter".
4. **Understand dependencies** — what settings, config, environment, or
   assumptions does this need?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and testing

1. **Form a single hypothesis** — state clearly: "I think X is the root
   cause because Y". Be specific.
2. **Test minimally** — make the smallest possible change to test the
   hypothesis. One variable at a time. Do not fix multiple things at once.
   Revert experimental code changes after observing the result so Phase 4
   starts from the failing baseline.
3. **Verify before continuing** — did it work? Yes → Phase 4. No → form a
   new hypothesis. Do not add more fixes on top.
4. **When you do not know** — say "I don't understand X". Do not pretend.
   Ask for help or research more.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Classify the bug.** Before any fix or verify plan, classify the bug using
   the same vocabulary as `brainstorm-feature`:

   - **Spike** — the real question is "is this actually a bug?" or "what is
     happening?", not "fix it." Output is an answer with reproduction evidence;
     do not write production code. Report the evidence and stop. If the answer
     reveals a real fix is needed, re-classify as Bounded or Architectural
     before proceeding.
   - **Bounded** — the fix stays within an existing flow and does not change a
     shared interface, contract, or component boundary. File count alone does
     not classify the bug. Proceed to step 2.
   - **Architectural** — the fix changes a shared interface, contract, or
     component boundary, or spans multiple components. Stop. Tell the user to
     invoke `brainstorm-feature` to produce a spec, then `plan-feature` for an
     execution plan, before any fix. Do not patch an architectural bug as if
     it were bounded; the verify plan in step 3 cannot cover cross-component
     regression surface that was never spec'd.

   When in doubt between two, take the heavier one. Hidden complexity
   discovered mid-fix upgrades the path — stop, say so, step up. Nothing
   downgrades mid-fix.

2. **Establish expected behavior.** Use source, tests, and current wiki pages.
   If they do not establish the intended behavior, stop and tell the user to
   invoke `brainstorm-feature` to get approval before changing behavior.
3. **Write the verify plan.** Before writing a regression test or production
   fix, list the observable conditions that prove the bug is fixed. State each
   as a checkable claim:
   - The original symptom no longer occurs (reproduction steps from Phase 1).
   - The regression test passes.
   - Traced callers and relevant existing tests do not regress (name the
     callers and checks from Phase 1).
   - Any contract the fix touches still holds (state the contract and how it
     is checked).
   - Any caller or contract without automated coverage is named with a direct
     check or reported as a verification limitation.

   This list is the definition of "fixed" for this bug. Step 9 checks the
   diff against it; `review-and-verify`'s "Bug fixed" row requires it. Without
   a written verify plan, "fixed" is a feeling, not a fact — do not proceed to
   step 4 until it is written.
4. **Write a regression test** that reproduces the original symptom.
5. **Verify the test fails** without the fix (red).
6. **Apply the smallest root-cause fix.** Reuse the verified working pattern
   from Phase 2 when it fits. A smaller-looking symptom patch is not minimal if
   sibling callers remain broken.
7. **Verify the test passes** (green).
8. **Run the full test suite** to check for regressions.
9. Call the available Skill entry whose local name is `review-and-verify` to
   review the diff against the
   verify plan from step 3 and run fresh verification. Tell the user to invoke
   `document-wiki` after verification only when the fix changes observable
   behavior or reveals stale wiki documentation. Do not update the wiki when it
   already correctly describes the intended behavior and the fix only restores
   code to that behavior.
10. Do not create commits during debugging. Even when the user requests a
    commit, wait until final `review-and-verify` passes.

## Red flags — stop and return to Phase 1

If you catch yourself thinking:

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "I'll know it's fixed when I see it" (no written verify plan)
- "It's just a bug, no need to classify" (skipping Spike/Bounded/Architectural)
- "The fix touches one file, so it's bounded" (file count is not the test — interface/contract impact is)
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals a new problem in a different place

**All of these mean: stop. Return to Phase 1.**

If 3+ fixes have failed, question the architecture. The pattern is wrong,
not the implementation.

## Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is faster than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Cannot isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms is not understanding root cause. |
| "I'll know it's fixed when I see it" | Without a written verify plan, "fixed" is a feeling. Write the checklist in Phase 4 step 3 before any fix. |
| "It's just a bug, no need to classify" | Architectural bugs patched as bounded cause cross-component regressions. Classify in Phase 4 step 1 before any fix. |
| "The fix touches one file, so it's bounded" | File count is not the test. If the fix changes an interface or contract others depend on, it is architectural — hand off to `brainstorm-feature`. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question the pattern. |

## When process reveals "no root cause"

If systematic investigation reveals the issue is truly environmental,
timing-dependent, or external:

1. Document what you investigated.
2. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message).
3. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation.

But: 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.
