# review-and-verify

## Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you have not run the verification command in this message, you cannot
claim it passes. "Should work" is not evidence. "Looks correct" is not
evidence. Previous runs are not evidence.

## Verification gate

Before claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. **Identify** — what command proves this claim?
2. **Run** — execute the full command (fresh, complete)
3. **Read** — full output, check exit code, count failures
4. **Verify** — does output confirm the claim?
   - If no: state actual status with evidence
   - If yes: state claim with evidence
5. **Only then** — make the claim

Before final completion, run every repository-mandated full verification
command documented in `AGENTS.md`, manifests, or CI configuration. Targeted
checks are useful during implementation but do not replace this final gate. If
no full command is established, report that limitation explicitly.

Before reviewing requirements, read the active spec and plan, including its
`## Decision Log`, plus any task-linked decision file. A persisted decision is
requirement evidence, but it does not override a pending approval gate;
conversation recall alone is not review evidence.

## Git safety invariants

- Treat existing working-tree changes as user-owned. Inspect `git status
  --short` and the relevant diff before changing or discarding anything.
- Never run `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`/`-xdf`, `git checkout -- <path>`,
  `git restore` that overwrites work, or broad delete commands to remove user
  changes unless the user explicitly authorizes the exact target and command.
- Never force-push or rewrite remote history without an explicit request naming
  the remote, branch, and intended rewrite. A request to finish, clean up, or
  fix the branch is not authorization.
- Prefer recoverable actions: inspect first, edit with the repository's normal
  tools, and leave commits and remote operations to the user unless explicitly
  requested.

## Claims vs evidence

| Claim | Requires | Not sufficient |
|---|---|---|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist vs spec, plan, and persisted decisions | Tests passing alone |
| Wiki updated | Source paths exist, links resolve | "Page edited" |

## Diff review

Review the diff for:

- **Correctness** — logic matches the approved design and persisted decisions
- **Stale documentation** — wiki pages or comments that contradict new behavior
- **Accidental scope** — changes outside the approved plan
- **Missing error handling** — edge cases, error paths, cleanup
- **Protected boundaries** — trust-boundary validation, security,
  accessibility, and data-loss prevention remain intact

For wiki changes, also verify: source paths exist, `## Sources` entries are
real, internal Obsidian wikilinks resolve, `INDEX.md` links resolve, and no
placeholder text remains.

Before the final result, classify wiki impact even for a bug fix. If the change
alters documented behavior or leaves a relevant page incomplete, use `yes` and
list the pages for a `document-wiki` handoff. Use `no` only after inspecting
the relevant page and source evidence. Use `not-applicable` when the repository
does not maintain `docs/llm/`, or `unknown` when the impact cannot be
established.

## Complexity pass

Review the diff for behavior-preserving simplifications. Report each finding
with a file reference and one of these labels:

- `delete:` dead code or flexibility with no approved requirement
- `reuse:` duplicated behavior already present in the repository
- `stdlib:` custom code replaced by a named standard-library feature
- `native:` dependency or custom code replaced by the platform
- `yagni:` abstraction, configuration, or extension point with no current use
- `shrink:` a smaller clear implementation with the same behavior and checks

Fix an in-scope finding before completion; otherwise report it as remaining
work. If none exist, state that the pass found none. Do not produce a line-count
score: fewer lines are useful only when approved behavior, readability, and
protected boundaries remain intact.

## Review result

End every review with this exact result block:

```md
Status: pass | fail
Evidence: <commands run and relevant results>
Blockers: <required fixes, or none>
Non-blockers: <optional findings, or none>
Spec gaps: <missing spec, plan, or persisted-decision requirements, or none>
Wiki impact: yes | no | not-applicable | unknown
Wiki pages: <paths, or none>
Wiki action: <invoke document-wiki / no update needed / limitation>
```

Use `fail` when any blocker or spec gap remains. A passing verification command
does not override a failed requirements or diff review.

## Receiving code review

When receiving feedback from a reviewer or user:

1. **Read** the complete feedback without reacting
2. **Understand** — restate the requirement in your own words or ask
3. **Verify** — check against codebase reality before implementing
4. **Evaluate** — is the suggestion technically sound for this codebase?
5. **Respond** — technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. **Implement** — one item at a time, test each

Never respond with performative agreement ("You're absolutely right!",
"Great point!"). State the fix or push back with technical reasoning. If
feedback is unclear, ask for clarification on all unclear items before
implementing any.

Push back when: suggestion breaks existing functionality, reviewer lacks
full context, violates YAGNI, or conflicts with architectural decisions.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Should work now" | Run the verification command |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence is not evidence |
| "Linter passed" | Linter is not compiler or test suite |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Fewer lines must be better" | A smaller diff that weakens behavior or clarity is a regression. |
| "The decision was only in chat" | Chat recall is not durable review evidence; persist behavior decisions before passing. |
| "It is only a bug fix" | A behavior-changing bug fix still requires a wiki-impact classification. |

## Report

Report any remaining limitation explicitly. A task is complete only when the
result block says `Status: pass` and code, documentation, and verification
output agree. Leave failed blockers for the implementer to fix; do not silently
turn them into non-blockers.

Leave the verified working tree for the user to review and commit. If the user
explicitly requests a commit, create it only after this final verification gate
passes; never commit known failing or unverified work.
