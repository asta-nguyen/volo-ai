# Using Devkit

Choose the owning workflow skill and follow its full instructions.

## Priority

Read context before changing files: run `read-codebase-context`, or
`setup-codebase` on a first visit.

## Shared rules

- New process artifacts under `docs/agent-devkit/` use
  `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue-id>-<slug>` before any type suffix when the task or a
  related artifact (including its filename) provides an issue ID. Otherwise
  keep the existing form. Never infer an ID or rename an artifact.
- A change with process files keeps them in one folder,
  `docs/agent-devkit/changes/YYYY-MM-DD-<issue-id>-<slug>/`, under the same
  naming rule. Keep the folder together; see the change lifecycle.
- For internal document links, use standard relative Markdown links
  (`[label](relative/path.md)`), resolved from the file containing the link.
  No Obsidian vault or app is required.
- When editing any document that contains legacy `[[...]]` links, convert
  every resolvable link in that document to relative Markdown and verify it.
  Resolve legacy targets using the owning workflow's existing target-root rule;
  read the exact target before converting and do not guess among duplicates. If
  `docs/llm/` contains legacy wikilinks during wiki work, migrate every
  resolvable internal link across the wiki in the `document-wiki` pass. If the
  task cannot include that full migration, route wiki work through
  `document-wiki`; do not report it complete while links remain mixed. Report
  missing or ambiguous targets instead of inventing them.
- Process artifacts stay under `docs/agent-devkit/`: never put them in
  `docs/llm/` or link to them from `docs/llm/`.

## Change lifecycle

`Approval Gate` records approval, not completion, for a change's `tasks.md`.
A change whose folder sits directly under `changes/` is open: revise its files
in place, and apply material changes through `tasks.md`'s decision log and
approval gate. `review-and-verify` moves the folder to
`changes/archive/<same name>/` only after final review passes; it merges a
verified `delta.md` when the change has one, and a change without a delta only
moves. That move marks the change complete. Change folders have no `Execution`
field and are never renamed.

Legacy plans in `docs/agent-devkit/plans/` keep their `Execution` lifecycle:
after all tasks pass final `review-and-verify`, that skill marks
`Execution: complete` in the plan's `## Approval Gate`, or adds `## Completion`
when the plan has no such section. Treat completed task results or an explicit
spec completion statement as historical scope; inspect remaining tasks and
final verification evidence before reusing the plan. Do not infer completion
from `Status: approved`.

For new work, classify with `brainstorm-feature`: a change gets a folder when it
produces a change file. An Architectural change always has `design.md` and
`tasks.md`; write `delta.md` only when a `docs/llm/` requirement needs `ADDED`,
`MODIFIED`, or `REMOVED`. A domain with no wiki page gets no delta and is
reported as `Wiki impact: yes`. After a change is archived, start a new change.
Keep archived changes, completed legacy plans, and legacy specs as history:
correct factual errors when needed, but do not add requirements, tasks, or
results to them. A delta only targets a page already in the `## Requirements`
format; convert a legacy `## Business rules` page through `document-wiki`, after
explicit page selection, before the delta names its IDs.

## Team Git workflow

Use one branch/PR per task; worktrees are optional. Keep repository and user
commit/push approval rules. When resolving conflicts in
`docs/agent-devkit/INDEX.md` or `docs/llm/INDEX.md`, preserve every task link
and verify all targets. Do not add locks or coordination tools.

## Routing map

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| First visit or missing repository conventions | `setup-codebase` |
| Set up or refresh OpenEZ when needed and approved | `setup-openez` |
| Understand affected code and callers | `read-codebase-context` |
| Pause unfinished work | `context-handoff` |
| Resume paused work | `context-handoff` Resume procedure |
| Create or refresh the LLM wiki | `document-wiki` |
| Whole-repository simplicity audit | `lean-audit` |
| New or ambiguous feature | `brainstorm-feature`; follow the handoff for its classification |
| Exact, low-risk, non-bug change | `brainstorm-feature` impact check → `implement-task` → `review-and-verify` |
| Bug or possible bug | `systematic-debugging` |
| Per-task AI estimate, when requested | `estimate-feature` |
| Turn an approved architectural design into tasks in its change folder | `plan-feature` |
| Revise an open architectural change (`tasks.md`) or an open legacy plan | `plan-feature` |
| Revise an open Bounded change (`delta.md`) | `brainstorm-feature` |
| Implement an approved design, tasks, or legacy plan | `implement-task` → `review-and-verify` |
| Archive a verified change and merge its wiki delta | `review-and-verify` |

The explicit-change row applies only after `brainstorm-feature` verifies
eligibility; otherwise it uses the approval gate. The arrow marks a required
handoff.

After `brainstorm-feature` classifies the request, route a Spike to
investigation and reporting, a Bounded feature to `implement-task`, and an
Architectural feature through `plan-feature` before implementation. Implemented
work still goes through `review-and-verify`.

## Bug classification

- **Diagnostic investigation** — asks whether something is a bug or what is
  happening; `systematic-debugging` investigates and reports evidence.
- **Bounded bug** — fixes an existing flow without changing a shared interface,
  contract, or component boundary; `systematic-debugging` verifies the fix.
- **Architectural bug** — changes a shared interface, contract, component
  boundary, or spans components; use `brainstorm-feature` → `plan-feature` →
  `implement-task` → `review-and-verify`.

When classification is unclear, start with `systematic-debugging`; it upgrades
architectural bugs to the full route. Diagnostic investigation is distinct
from `brainstorm-feature`'s feasibility Spike. This skill routes only and
requires the full devkit skill set. In namespaced hosts use entries such as
`agent-devkit:review-and-verify`; direct installs use the bare skill name.
